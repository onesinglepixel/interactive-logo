# interactive-logo
Javascript and HTML5 Canvas powered interactive logo using any supplied image

# How to Use
you will need to create the image file you want to use in rgba - you can use any image format including svg
The image will need to have the alpha for all colors set to 0.1 so that the image is almost invisible

The script will pick this image up and create an array from each pixel of the artwork and allow them to be interacted with within html canvas
The alpha for these pixels will be set back to 1 so that the colours ar visible
